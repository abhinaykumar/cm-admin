# CmAdmin

New CmAdmin gem

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'cm_admin'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install cm_admin

## Usage

Install the gem

    $ rails g cm_admin:install

This will generate an initializer which contains the basic setup. This also includes a layout called `admin` which can be used in the application.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
